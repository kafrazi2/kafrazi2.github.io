# Reflection
In this project, my partner and I manipulated and summarized data from the [online news popularity data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity). We then created predictive models to find which variables increased or decreased the amount of shares a post received. After choosing our best fit models, we automated our report so that we can look at our data across multiple channels in this data set.

The way my partner and I write and set up our code varied, so to make things easier next time, it would be better to go over how we want the document to look before starting on the code to save time. 

The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to work with a partner online without coding over each other's work or creating errors for the other partner. At the beginning, we both were just writing code for the project and committing these updates whenever we could which led to some errors and confusion early on, but we figured it out and the way we finished our project was very smooth.

The biggest takeaway for me with this project was the automation part. I didn't realize before how simple it was to automate a report to create output for different data. This is going to help me in the future when I am coding and want to quickly analyze output for a lot of data.
I also got a lot more comfortable with Github during this project and saw all the value it can bring when collaborating with others.
