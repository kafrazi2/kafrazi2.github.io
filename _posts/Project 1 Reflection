# Reflection
In this project I created a vignette that grabbed data from the NASA API. Once I grabbed the data, I created functions to hepl parse and customize it. After that, I designed tables and graphs to look at possible trends and relationships in the data. 

The most difficult part of the logic and programming part was getting the data from the APIs into a data frame so that I can find ways to query the data. I struggled with making the data useable so that I could create graphs and tables later on.

In the future, I would try to read up more on how to retrieve and parse data from APIs before I started the project so that I can easily do this and move onto the next part of the project. I would also try and do more research on the APIs I I was looking at to make it easier to create functions.
