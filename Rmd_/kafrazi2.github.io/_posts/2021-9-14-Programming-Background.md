## Thoughts on R vs. other languages

### I like using R because it is a very commonly used language, so it is easy to collaborate with other and get help through the internet when I am struggling with my code. I like all of the different packages that you can install in R that makes certain aspects of coding easier than in other languages.

### The other language that I am more comfortable with is SAS. I miss this language because I have worked with it for so long that I know all the basic functions and I understand what the errors mean more in this language.

### I think R is a fairly easy language to learn compared to other languages I have worked with. It is very user-friendly.
